# Starcoin Test Dapp

This is a simple test dapp for use in Starcoin e2e tests and manual QA.

Currently hosted [here](https://starcoin-test-dapp.vercel.app).

## Warning

Online verison does not work, because the node URL protocol now is not HTTPS.

To test the dapp, you should clone the repo and run it on your local computer.

## Development

1. Install dependencies

```
yarn
````

2. Start local server

```
yarn start
```

3. Open browser(Chrome/Safari/Firefox, etc), and go to http://localhost:9022
